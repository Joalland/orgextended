  Core Idea: Inline Babel Blocks
             #+header: comments

  With this release we are focusing on some fringe pieces
  of the core babel feature set that we need to be complete.

  Inline babel blocks allow you to call a babel function within
  some other text providing even more dynamic living breathing documents.

  Header blocks extend the core babel features providing more real estate to add
  parameters to a source block.

** Links
	- Bugfix thanks to Anti-Distinctlyminty - on windows uses os.startfile() to launch a file link
	  providing better support for out of sublime file links. Also some improved error notation
	  in the contols when a link cannot resolve.

** Input
	- Additional guards against asserts in popups for the input box:
	  [[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended/issues/28][Errors in Sublime Console]]

	  Thanks to OlegBc for finding this one.

** TODO Inline Blocks

	Basic inline source block syntax highlighting

	src_python[:var x=5]{print("hello" + str(x))} {{{results(=hello=)}}}

** TODO HEADER comments
** Buffer Swap Respects Startup
	I find that as I move around the buffer I tend to unfold a lot of "things"
	When I have a buffer set to "content" mode I like it to clean up the open folds when it can.
	
	This new setting will allow sublime to aggressively cleanup the folds to just your active subtree
	of the file if you turn this on.

	What I really want is org-narrow-to-subtree which is the ability to restrict a view to a narrowing of the buffer
	but in the absence of that capability this helps keep me focused on the
	things that matter in my file.

	- This is controlled by a setting:
