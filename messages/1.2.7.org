* 1.2.7
	Core Idea: Quality of Life

	This release is about stability, testing and validating the core babel feature set before I move on to noweb and tangle.

** Babel Unit Tests
	- Having most of the core babel features in place we have started to work towards
	  validating the core babel feature set and putting a rough stamp of non preview on
	  the babel feature set.

	- Added "Org Show Table Tests" and "Org Show Source Block Tests" which will create a file with the unit tests
	  for these features as a means of documentation and exploration for new users.

  - FIXED: Issues with multiple :var statements on the fence line of a babel block.
  - FIXED: Exception with initial inserts with drawer formatter. 

** SBE

	- FIXED: The Source Block Execute method had a bug that was preventing propper execution due to some
	  of the features introduced in 1.2.6
	- FIXED: cell being passed to an sbe function would sometimes not evaluate properly.

** Table Execution
	- New command: "Org Execute Formula" This will only execute the formula targetting the current cell vs the entire table.
	  This can help when building a table.

** Table Highlights
	- Some expressions using SBE can get fairly expensive to compute. When highlighting cells the system executes
	  formulas in the background to determine which cells the formula touches. To avoid paying that cost when moving
	  around you can turn this off for a node in the heirarchy as follows:

	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      :PROPERTIES:
        :NoTableHighlight: True
      :END:
	  #+END_EXAMPLE

	  I had to do this for the unit tests since our unit tests were generating diagrams as a result of the sbe calls
	  Although an unrealistic real world case, this was slowing down the highlight to be somewhat unusable so merited
	  the feature.

** Day Page
	- olegBc asked for a day page system. The project still has a little definition before we know where we need to take it.
	  That said, I added a text command to create a day page as a first little step in that direction.
