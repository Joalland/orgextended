* 1.2.7
	Core Idea: Quality of Life

	This release is about stability, testing and validating the core babel feature set.

** Babel Unit Tests
	- Having most of the core babel features in place we have started to work towards
	  validating the core babel feature set and putting a rough stamp of non preview on
	  the babel feature set.

	- Added "Org Show Table Tests" and "Org Show Source Block Tests" which will create a file with the unit tests
	  for these features as a means of documentation and exploration for new users.

** SBE
	- FIXED: The Source Block Execute method had a bug that was preventing propper execution due to some
	  of the features introduced in 1.2.6

** Table Highlights
	- Some expressions using SBE can get fairly expensive to compute. When highlighting cells the system executes
	  formulas in the background to determine which cells the formula touches. To avoid paying that cost when moving
	  around you can turn this off for a node in the heirarchy as follows:

	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      :PROPERTIES:
        :NoTableHighlight: True
      :END:
	  #+END_EXAMPLE
