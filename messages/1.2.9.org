** Babel Cache
   This mode is dangerous if the operation has any side effects.

   It does  however skip execution when the operation is already present.
   It will keep a hash of the source and params and will only execute
   if the source does not change.

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :cache yes :var x=5 :tangle yes
	  print("Hello world") 
	#+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS[5ce4498b4cf15deb48101207ad5673485754fd11]:
   : Hello world

** Never Eval
	A security feature of org is that you can specify that a block should never execute.
	This is now mostly working.

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval never
		print("hi")	  
	#+END_SRC

** Query Eval

	Query evaluation is mostly working now although the title is not great.

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval query :tangle yes
	  print("Hello World")
	#+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello World
