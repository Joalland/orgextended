* 1.2.10
  Dateutil seems to have vanished on package control. This was causing some people to have problems installing.
  I have been forced (for now) to embed dateutil into orgextended so we can continue chugging along.

  My hope is that in doing this it will fix the ST3 issues we have been seeing.
