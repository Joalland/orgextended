* 1.2.7
	Core Idea: Quality of Life

	This release is about stability, testing and validating the core babel feature set.

** Babel Unit Tests
	- Having most of the core babel features in place we have started to work towards
	  validating the core babel feature set and putting a rough stamp of non preview on
	  the babel feature set.

	- Added "Org Show Table Tests" and "Org Show Source Block Tests" which will create a file with the unit tests
	  for these features as a means of documentation and exploration for new users.

** SBE
	- FIXED: The Source Block Execute method had a bug that was preventing propper execution due to some
	  of the features introduced in 1.2.6
