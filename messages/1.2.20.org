* 1.2.20
** Html Exporter
	Continuing the Babel adventure we add support for :exports [code,results,both,none]

	NOTE: this means that the default parameters for babel header args are now more important
	      Before we would default to exporting both code and results, now, due to the defaults set in our settings
	      we only export code. This is in complaince with org mode defaults. If you would like to change that
	      add the key to your settings file and set the defaults as you need:

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "orgBabelDefaultHeaderArgs": ":session none :results replace :exports code :cache no :noweb no",
	#+END_EXAMPLE
