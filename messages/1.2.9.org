* 1.2.9

** Babel Cache
   This mode is dangerous if the operation has any side effects.

   It does  however skip execution when the operation is already present.
   It will keep a hash of the source and params and will only execute
   if the source does not change.

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :cache yes :var x=5 :tangle yes
	  print("Hello world") 
	#+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS[5ce4498b4cf15deb48101207ad5673485754fd11]:
   : Hello world

** Never Eval
	A security feature of org is that you can specify that a block should never execute.
	This is now mostly working.

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval never
		print("hi")	  
	#+END_SRC

** Query Eval

	Query evaluation is mostly working now although the title is not great.

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval query :tangle yes
	  print("Hello World")
	#+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello World

** Tangle
   This release marks the begining of tangle work. Marking a source block as tangleable
   allows someone to export just the source code to a "detangled" file containing the source code and data
   from the page. The resulting file will have the name of the the org file with the appropriate file extension
   for the source code.

   #+BEGIN_SRC powershell :var y=5 :tangle yes
   	Write-Host("Hello World")
   #+END_SRC
